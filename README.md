# extremeSnake

This is a project to create a more "extreme" version of the classic Snake Game.
The goal was to create a universal swift app, which could be deployed to all iOS, tvOS, macOS & watchOS devices.

Key features currently planned to extend the classic Snake game are:
* Multiple Game modes (including "Classic" which emulates the basic Snake game)
* Collectible PowerUps
* Challenge Modes
  * Time Trial (instead of accelerating when consuming food, you accelerate every frame
  * Survival Mode (survive as long as possible with moving enemies & other obstacles
  * Side scroller
